If you want to submit and/or maintain distribution of your choice for official Shells build, you must meet the following criteria:

* Make sure image is ready for Shells infrastructure (look for example into other OS build scripts here in repository).
* No password for users (we disable the passwords, enabled passwordless sudo and passwordless polkit auth in firstrun script, so keep that in mind).
* Set user to autologin (we try to achieve this in firstrun script but if you see difference not applying for your OS, be sure to do it).
* Disable power saving (screensavers, sleep, automatic logout etc).
* Disable logout option.
* Shells images are running on our Shells kernel, if you want your images to be ran by your distro kernel, you will need to supply that kernel, a way to resize the disk, a bootloader, the kernel parameters etc.
